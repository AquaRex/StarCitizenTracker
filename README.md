<h1>üö¶How to useüö¶</h1>
Once you open it, a few windows will appear with some text to show you how it will look.<br>
You can close the windows you don't want by pressing ( X )<br>
Click and drag the windows to where you want them.<br>
Press the "Lock" button to lock them in place. This hides the background and clears the text.<br>
It's now ready to read your Game.Log file, and is awaiting any changes to it.

<h1>üî® Can I get banned for using this?</h1>

<h2>TLDR: No </h2> 
This application ONLY reads from the game's own Game.Log ( console output ) file.<br>
All the information this application is pulling is publically avaliable in the in-game console.<br>
The application is simply sorting and assuming functionality of console outputs to make it more readable.<br><br>
There may be inaccuracies in the information this application presents due to this assumption.<br>
And any updates to Star Citizen may change how the console prints and what it prints and therefore may break the functionality of this application at any point.
